## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Where to report:** Open a **private** security advisory on GitHub: go to this repository → **Security** → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**. Do not open a public issue for security-sensitive details.

**What to include:**

- Description of the vulnerability and affected code paths or config
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Impact (e.g. data exposure, privilege escalation)
- Suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

**What to expect:**

- **Acknowledgement:** We aim to confirm receipt within 5 business days.
- **Updates:** We will update you on the advisory thread at least every 2 weeks until the issue is resolved or declined.
- **If accepted:** We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you. You will be credited in the advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
- **If declined:** We will explain why and close the advisory; you may still publish your findings after we respond.

**Out of scope:** Theoretical issues with no practical impact, or issues in dependencies that have no fix and no workaround. We may direct you to upstream projects when appropriate.
